# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building the authentication system for a tire & wheel stock management mobile application. As the first phase of the project, we will implement secure authentication and login functionality that will serve as the foundation for future inventory management features. The system will handle user authentication using Thai phone numbers as user IDs and 6-digit PINs as passwords, session management, and secure token-based access control. This authentication layer will protect future endpoints for tire inventory, wheel stock, sales tracking, and other business operations. User accounts will be created manually in the database by administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a tire & wheel shop employee, I want to log in with my phone number and PIN, so that I can access the stock management system and perform my daily tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid Thai phone number and 6-digit PIN THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and return an access token
2. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
3. WHEN a user submits credentials for a non-existent phone number THEN the system SHALL return an error message
4. WHEN a user submits invalid phone number format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
5. WHEN a user submits invalid PIN format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
6. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL return both access and refresh tokens
7. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL log the login event

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tire & wheel shop employee, I want my login session to remain active during my work shift, so that I don't have to re-authenticate frequently while managing inventory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user receives an access token THEN the token SHALL be valid for a specified duration
2. WHEN an access token expires THEN the system SHALL accept a valid refresh token to issue a new access token
3. WHEN a refresh token is used THEN the system SHALL issue both new access and refresh tokens
4. WHEN a refresh token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL require full re-authentication
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate both access and refresh tokens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want to protect stock management API endpoints, so that only authenticated employees can access tire and wheel inventory data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to a protected endpoint with a valid token THEN the system SHALL allow access
2. WHEN a request is made to a protected endpoint without a token THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
3. WHEN a request is made to a protected endpoint with an invalid token THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
4. WHEN a request is made to a protected endpoint with an expired token THEN the system SHALL return a token expired error
5. WHEN a valid token is provided THEN the system SHALL extract user information for the request context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a tire & wheel shop employee, I want to securely log out at the end of my shift, so that my account and the inventory system remain protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates logout THEN the system SHALL invalidate the current access token
2. WHEN a user initiates logout THEN the system SHALL invalidate the current refresh token
3. WHEN logout is successful THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation response
4. WHEN a user attempts to use invalidated tokens THEN the system SHALL reject the requests
5. WHEN logout occurs THEN the system SHALL log the logout event

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a tire & wheel shop owner/administrator, I want employee PINs to be securely stored, so that employee access credentials and business data remain protected even if the database is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user PIN is stored THEN the system SHALL hash the PIN using a secure algorithm
2. WHEN a user PIN is stored THEN the system SHALL use a unique salt for each PIN
3. WHEN authenticating a user THEN the system SHALL compare hashed PINs
4. WHEN the system processes PINs THEN plain text PINs SHALL never be stored
5. WHEN PIN hashing occurs THEN the system SHALL use industry-standard security practices
