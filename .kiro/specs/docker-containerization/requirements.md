# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will containerize the tt-stock-api Go application using Docker and provide a complete development environment with PostgreSQL using Docker Compose. The containerization will enable consistent development environments, simplified deployment, and better isolation of dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run the entire application stack (API + PostgreSQL) using Docker Compose, so that I can have a consistent development environment without installing Go or PostgreSQL locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `docker-compose up` THEN the system SHALL start both the API service and PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN the containers start THEN the API SHALL automatically connect to the PostgreSQL database
3. WHEN the API container starts THEN it SHALL automatically create the required database tables
4. WHEN I make code changes THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading for development

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker setup to require explicit environment configuration, so that I cannot accidentally run the application with insecure default values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the containers start THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN I provide a custom .env file THEN the system SHALL use those values
3. WHEN required environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL refuse to start and display clear error messages
4. WHEN the database starts THEN it SHALL use explicitly provided credentials and database configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker images to be optimized for both development and production use, so that I can use the same containerization approach across all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for development THEN the system SHALL include development tools and support hot reloading
2. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL create a minimal, secure image without development dependencies
3. WHEN the production image runs THEN it SHALL use a non-root user for security
4. WHEN building the image THEN it SHALL use multi-stage builds to minimize final image size

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want persistent data storage for the PostgreSQL database, so that my data survives container restarts and I can maintain development state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PostgreSQL container restarts THEN the system SHALL preserve all database data
2. WHEN I run `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up` THEN the database data SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN I need to reset the database THEN the system SHALL provide commands to clear persistent volumes
4. WHEN the database initializes for the first time THEN it SHALL create the required database and user automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the containerized setup to integrate with the existing Makefile commands, so that I can use familiar development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run existing make commands THEN the system SHALL work with the containerized environment
2. WHEN I want to run tests THEN the system SHALL support running tests inside containers
3. WHEN I want to access the database directly THEN the system SHALL provide easy access methods
4. WHEN I want to view logs THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging from both API and database containers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Docker setup to handle database migrations and initial setup automatically, so that I don't need manual database configuration steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API container starts THEN it SHALL wait for PostgreSQL to be ready before connecting
2. WHEN the database connection is established THEN the system SHALL automatically run table creation
3. WHEN the containers start for the first time THEN the system SHALL set up the database schema without manual intervention
4. IF the database is not ready THEN the API container SHALL retry connection with exponential backoff
